# PowerShell Bin
A collection of useful PowerShell scripts I've found, written, and played with.

## Set PowerShell Path 
To set your path variable in powershell, modify the string below to point to
some directory where you want to store scripts like the ones in PowerShell Bin:

`$env:Path += ";C:\Users\USERNAME\bin"`

Save the string in the following file (you may need to create the folder too):

`C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1`
